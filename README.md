# Association Websites
This repo aims to create functional templates for some non-profit associations and organizations in Colombia. The idea is supporting their mission with a functional and good looking website.

It will be Django Rest (backend) and React (frontend).


## Website Design Inspirations

Association websites must be bilingual. In this worldwide view, web desings that integrate and include the communities culture, traditions and social views with a vanguard design is a MUST. Some of those inspirations are:

1. [Vangogh Museum](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en)
2. [Louvre Museum](https://www.louvre.fr/en)
3. [Rose Family Restaurants](https://rosefamily.com.ua/)
4. [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu/)


## Associations

### Devolver Conciencia

Here the website mirror to structure the backend, and DB will be its common ally Si Puedo Colombia, another non-profit organization in Colombia aiming to divulgate Colombians studying or graduated from International Universities to motivate young generations. [Their website](https://sipuedocolombia.wixsite.com/sipuedocolombia/inicio).

### DB

Using [DBML](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home) I picture the database comfortably and simple, easy to use to convert to most "common" database types (by default it converts to Postgresql), and visualize (cmd+shift p, Generate Prisma UML) using [Generate Prisma UML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AbianS.prisma-generate-uml) for vscode.
